## Project Description
Apple, a tech giant known for its revolutionary and game-changing products, has carved its place as one of the most esteemed and valuable companies worldwide. In this project, we will delve into Apple's historical stock data, tracing its remarkable evolution from its humble beginnings to the present day (as of June 9th, 2023 in the dataset). I will leverage the power of Python and Bokeh library to analyze the intricacies of Apple's stock, uncover insights, and craft interactive visualizations that bring its fascinating story to life.

## Key Business Questions
- How have Apple's closing prices and trading volumes evolved over time?
- What is the highest closing price Apple's stock has ever reached?
- What was the moving average of Apple stock?
- What were the daily returns of Apple's stock during the period?
- Can we create charts, such as a candlestick chart or a linear colour map, to visually represent the performance of Apple's stock and aid decision-making?

## Tools that I used in this project
- Python and Pandas library
- Viz tools: Bokeh library
- Google Colab notebook

## Dataset
